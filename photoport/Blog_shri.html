							<h2>On the Song I loved so much, I decided to write about it</h2>
							<p> Bon Iver is not a very famous name, even within indie bands. It has kind of a niche audience, like Cigaretts after Sex, which is also one of my absolute  favourite bands, which has a very small, and rather selfish cluster of fans. But apart from that, it was amazing to see a couple of weeks before, Bon Iver releasing it's two new singles after a long time, one of whihc I'm writing about now. Hey,Ma, has an amazing melancholic cacophony, which still sounds amazing to the ears, and some melodramatic and eloquent lyrics, in Justin Vernon's flushed baritone.
							<br>
							Just listen to the song, it's amazing and open to a wide range of interpretations as you may want to, as it is somewhat cryptic relating to Justin's childhood. Here he talks about all his reflections and troubled times where his mom corrected him in every way, the general idea what is meant to be translated to the listener is that when you are "Back and forth with light", means when its not all summer and fun, on the gloomy days, it's tall time to call your ma and have yourself saved.
							Any blog, any piece of writing will not do justice to this utter masterpiece which is made here, can do justice to the emotion and the amazing lyrics of this song. Thanks for exixting, Bon Iver. This song is certainly one of my favourites, so much so that it has forced me to write about it.
							Do yourself a favour today and listen to this masterpiece:<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDAKS18Gv1U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDAKS18Gv1U</a>
